# Bouncy Balls

**Bouncy Balls** is a simple gimmick, animating moving balls, bouncing on walls.

## How to
Click anywhere on the page to spawn a circle with random properties: starting position, size, color, moving speed, moving direction.
Click again to spawn another circle. \
All circles on the screnn are bouncing on walls (borders of inner view), like the famous dvd-logo-bouncing.

## How it works, technically
**Bouncy Balls** is powered by [Konva](https://www.npmjs.com/package/konva),
which is powered by HTML [Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp).
